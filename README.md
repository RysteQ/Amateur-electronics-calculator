# Amateur electronics calculator

This is an amateur electronics calculator I made with the notes of a book I have back when I was in the first year of highschool so it **may be inaccurate in some calculations** there and there and I **haven't really checked for any bugs** that much. In all honestly, you can probably learn everything this "calculator" has in just a single day at most if you put the effort in it.
